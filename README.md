# **Customer-churn-Prediction**

This project was developed as part of my internship program at UneeQ, focusing on building a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning. The goal is to help improve customer retention by proactively identifying users likely to leave.

# **Project Overview**

Customer churn is a critical business problem where companies lose revenue when customers stop using their service. In this project, 

- Cleaned and explored real-world churn data
- Applied traditional ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression,XGboost and Balanced Random Forest)
- Fine-tuned a transformer model (DistilBERT) for text-based customer features (if used)
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

# **Dataset**
I used A dataset from Uneeq organization which is anonymized version

# **Visualizations**
- Confusion Matrix (to evaluate misclassifications)
- SHAP Summary Plot (to explain model decisions)
